Release 0.1.0 - Initial MERN Stack Implementation

    Date: April 17, 2025

    Summary: This release marks the successful completion of the initial development phase, transitioning the project from a Django-based plan to a MERN stack architecture. The core functionalities for user management, course Browse, and community posting have been implemented.

Added:

    MERN Stack Integration: The entire backend is now built with Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

    User Authentication: Implemented user registration, login, and secure session management using JWT.

    Course Catalog: Users can now view a list of all available courses and their details.

    Community Forum: A basic posting system has been added, allowing users to create posts and interact with comments and likes.

    Student Dashboard: A preliminary dashboard is in place, displaying enrolled courses for a logged-in student.

    Responsive Design: The frontend is now responsive across all major devices thanks to Tailwind CSS.

Changed:

    Backend Framework: Switched from Django to Node.js/Express.js.

    Database: Migrated the data model from a PostgreSQL-like schema to MongoDB's document-based structure.

    Authentication: Switched from Django's built-in system to JWT and Passport.js.

    Styling: Replaced custom CSS with Tailwind CSS for a more efficient styling workflow.

Known Issues:

    Advanced search functionality is not yet fully implemented.

    The AI-powered chat and filtering features are not included in this release.

    The admin dashboard is still under development.

    Error handling for some API endpoints could be improved.
